TO INSTALL

If you use %appdata% to store your Notepad++ config (Check to see whether %appdata%\Notepad++ exists) then copy the XML file to that directory.
If not, copy it to the Install Directory in Program Files.

You'll probably get prompted to overwrite the existing file, you may want to backup your old one if you have any user defined languages of your own...

Thanks for Downloading!
